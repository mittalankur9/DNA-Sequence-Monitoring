# Time-Series-Analysis-in-DNA-Sequencing-for-Monitoring-Disease-Progression-and-Treatment-Response
Time series analysis is an effective method for comprehending dynamic biological processes, such as the progression of disease and the response to treatment. Time series data in the context of DNA sequencing provide an extensive picture of molecular changes over time, yielding important insights into underlying mechanisms of disease and the effectiveness of treatment interventions. This study examines the use of time series analysis in DNA sequencing to track the advancement of disease and the effectiveness of treatment. We go over several statistical techniques and computational strategies used to examine gene expression profiles, DNA methylation patterns, and chromatin accessibility dynamics in longitudinal genomic data. In addition, we draw attention to the difficulties and possibilities associated with combining clinical data with time series analysis to support precision medicine and personalized treatment. We demonstrate how time series analysis can be used to better understand disease processes and to untangle the temporal dynamics of biological systems. In conclusion, we go over upcoming directions and new developments in this multidisciplinary subject, highlighting how time series analysis may help advance precision medicineâ€™s prognostics, therapeutic approaches and diagnostics.
